[아일릿 "Magnetic" 가사]

[Intro: Wonhee]
Baby, I'm just trying to play it cool
But I just can't hide that
I want you

[Verse 1: Minju, Iroha]
Wait a minute, 이게 뭐지? (뭐지?)
내 심장이 love-dub
자꾸만 뛰어
저 멀리서도 oh, (Oh) my (My) gosh (Gosh)
끌어당겨 you're my crush
초능력처럼

[Pre-Chorus: Yunah, Moka, Wonhee]
거대한 자석이 된 것만 같아 my heart
네 모든 게 내 맘에 달라붙어버려, boy
We're magnetized, 인정할게
This time, I want

[Chorus: Wonhee, Minju]
You, you, you, you, like it's magnetic
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you super 이끌림
You, you, you, you, like it's magnetic
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you super 이끌림

[Verse 2: Minju, Wonhee]
정반대 같아 our type
넌 J 난 완전 P
S와 N 극이지만
그래서 끌리지
내가 만들래 green light
여잔 배짱이지
So let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go

[Pre-Chorus: Moka, Yunah, Iroha]
숨기고 싶지 않아 자석 같은 my heart
내 맘의 끌림대로 너를 향해 갈게, boy
We're magnetized, 인정할게
This time, I want

[Bridge: Yunah, Minju, Moka, Iroha, *Wonhee*]
No push and pull, 전속력으로 너에게 갈게 (In a rush, in a rush)
Our chemistry, 난 과몰입해 지금 순간에 (Baby, you're my crush, you're my crush)
No push and pull, 네게 집중 후회는 안 할래 (Gonna dash, gonna dash)
Never holding back, 직진해, yeah (직진해, yeah)
*This time, I want*

[Chorus: Wonhee, Moka]
You, you, you, you, like it's magnetic
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you super 이끌림
